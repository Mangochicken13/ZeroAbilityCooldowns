Once you install BepInEx and run it, put the mod's .dll file into the `BepInEx\plugins` folder to install it

Playing mods requires purchasing the full game on Steam: \

To play mods with other people both users have to install the mod (and have the same configurations if there are any)

# Warning
Install at your own risk, this is an unnoficial mod for a game, regardless of how "official" the discord server wants to sound, and mods are inherently a security risk to your computer and data
